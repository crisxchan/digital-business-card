            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>A fresh graduate with over just a year of
            professional experience as a Developer, I 
            enjoy putting into reality design concepts 
            or blueprints to actual web pages. I have a
            knack for figuring things out, finding root
            causes for errors and eventually designing 
            its optimal solution. I consider Javascript 
            as my strong point, with exposure to C# and 
            Java. I look forward to becoming a .NET full
            stack developer in the coming months.</p>
